# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

In this project i wanted to try React Native out and se how i could use the sensors in the phone. I choose to build an App that gives you a new random trail suggestion when shaken.

## The problem

I thought it was so awesome to see the screen on the phone updated while I was writing my code on the computer. The first thing I did was print the x, y and z variable on the screen to see how the numbers changed when I touched the phone.

I had to be properly planned this week to get to the project due to the fact that I had so little time to spend this week. It was important that I put the time into the right things, so I started by planning what functions I wanted, then I ticked off one function after another.

If I had more time, I would make sure to get a nicer design. And above that I would like a back button, which sets the store to "null" so that you get back to the start page and can choose a new location.
